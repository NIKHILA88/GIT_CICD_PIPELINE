ssh-keygen' on new ds
    hit enter through everything and use the defaults
cat the ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub file
 
go into the project you would like the server to be able to read/write to and along the left side go to settings -> repository
Scroll down to "Deploy Keys" and paste the .pub key into that box and call it "gcp-ds-deploy-key" or something like that and check the box for write capability as well
 
You should now be able to go back to the deployment and be able to git clone "ssh link of the repo" and pull it in there

after that execute the below commands on server

git remote -v
 git status
  git add -A .
  git commit -m "Adding apps"
   git push origin master
   git push origin master --force
